# project1

This is literally homework for my operating systems class.
I am also practicing how to push my commits to GitHub through the command line.
You might see another README.md in the log (if you can access it), and that's because I accidentally deleted the first one when I pushed this repository to GitHub.
I think that's how it works at least. Pushing your local repository deletes everything else? That's messed up.

## Anyway,
this is attempt 2, so bear with me
