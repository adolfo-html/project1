# project1

This is literally homework for my operating systems class.
I am also practicing how to push my commits to GitHub through the command line.
You might see another README.md in the log (if you can access it), and that's because I accidentally deleted the first one when I pushed this repository to GitHub.
I think that's how it works at least. Pushing your local repository deletes everything else? That's messed up.

## Anyway,
this is attempt 2, so bear with me

## NICE
Ok so I made this file then typed:

$ git add .
$ git commit 'blah blah blah'
$ git push -u origin main

I still need to figure out what the flag and everything past that means (-u, origin, and main)
But I'll log it here and hopefully in the future I'll make sure not to delete any important files.

Earlier I did a pull command in the terminal and that actually downloaded another separate directory.
I wonder if I can do a git pull command so that I can update my local directory (with a different name) to match the GitHub repository.

I should start a blog. I was actually thinking I could start it on my LinkedIn account
But I like keeping my professional career separate from what I like doing, which is programming stuff and typing commands in the terminal like a boss
At the same time I think my professional career is important...
There's a section on my LinkedIn account where I can put a link to my GitHub projects so I think that'll be neat, once I have more to show (or maybe I should stop putting things off)

ANYWAY let's do some more pushing and pulling practice cause this is kinda fun
