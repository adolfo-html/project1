// IMPORTANT: I need to implement the instructions in RAM thing.
// So I need to get the instructions from the text file and sequentially set them in the RAM array.
// I plan on doing this by getting the instructions as an INT instead of a string.
// So, to optimize a little, I'm going to try to change the initial string myText to an int at first.
// This can be problematic but I'm not sure. Because I don't know if the getline function will accept an int value.

// Looks like that didn't work

// Now I'm gonna try getting it as a string, then I'll convert the string to an int later for operation.
// That works

	cout << "\n\n";

	// Remember to set the ifstream object AFTER you have a value for fileName...
	ifstream file(fileName);
	ifstream file1(fileName);

	// The getline function will collect text line by line. Two parameters: your file, and the text variable the output is going to.
	// This while loop is cool because it makes it so the program goes through all the lines/instructions, and stops when there are no more lines. Nice

	// Set RAM address initial values to "000" BEFORE I actually collect the instructions. Whoops
	for (int f = 0; f < 1000; f++)
		ram[f] = "000";

	// Collecting instructions in RAM
	int instCount = 0;
	while (getline(file, myText))
	{
		ram[instCount] = myText;
		instCount++;
	}
	// WORKS!


// So here it's getting all the instructions and setting it to its sequential ram position.
// Afterwards the next getline function (below) doesn't read anything, so let me try setting the ifstream object again.

//	ifstream file(fileName); The object was previously declared! So I have to make a new "file" filename, I guess. I'll just make two up above and be done with it...
